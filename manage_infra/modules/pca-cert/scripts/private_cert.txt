#place holder for cert file. data file needs be present for plan phase to work after deployment.
#with this approach every time we run a build we are updating a cert even if it exists. Only way (known) to stop this is to move logic to script.
# apart from reloading same certificate on deployment there is no other side effect of this approach. With support of temp files in terraform we might be able to
# do it in better way.
